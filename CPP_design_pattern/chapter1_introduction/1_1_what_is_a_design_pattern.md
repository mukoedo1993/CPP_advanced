You may want to avoid redesign, or at least minimize it. Experienced object-oriented designers will tell you
that a reusbale and flexible design is difficult if not impossible to get "right" the first time.<br>

# Christopher Alexander:
Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core
of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without even doing
it the same way twice.

# Pattern
## four essential elements
1: The *pattern name* is a handle we can use to describe a design problem.
2: The *problem* describes when to apply the pattern.
3: The *solution* describes the elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations.
4: The *consequences* are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern.

The design patterns in this book are descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve
a general design problem in a particular context.
