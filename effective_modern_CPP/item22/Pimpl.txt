If you've ever had to combat excessive build times, you're familiar with the Pimpl ("Pointer to implementation") Idiom.
That's the technique whereby you replace the data members of a class with a pointer to an implementation class or struct,
put the data members that used to be in the primary class into the implementation class, and access those data memebrs indirectly 
through the pointer.
