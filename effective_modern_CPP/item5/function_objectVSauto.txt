Why do we prefer auto then a function object? 
It's important to recognize that even setting aside the syntatic verbosity and need to repeat the parameter types,
using std::function is not the same as using auto. An auto-declared variable holding a closure has the same type as the 
closure, and as such it uses only as much memory as the closure requires.
