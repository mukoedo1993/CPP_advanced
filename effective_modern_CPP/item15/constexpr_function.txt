Usage scenarios for constexpr objects become more interesting when constexpr
functions are involved. Such functions produce compile-time constants when they are called with compile-time
constants. If they're called with values not known until runtime, they produce runtime values. This may sound as if don't know
what they'll do, but that's the wrong way to think about it. The right way to view it is this:

constexpr functions can be used in contexts...
