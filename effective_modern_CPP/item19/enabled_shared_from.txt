Internally, shared_from_this looks up the control block for the current object, and it creates a new std::shared_ptr that
refers to that control block. The design relies on the current object having an associated control block. For that to be the
case, there must be an existing std::shared_ptr (e.g., one outside the member function calling shared_from_this) that points to the current
object. If no such std::shared_ptr exists, (i.e. if the current object has no associated control block), behavior is undefined, although shared_from
_this typically throws an exception.


unqiue_ptr -> shared_ptr easy
