Today's C++ is a multiparadigm programming language, one supporting a combination of procedural, object-oriented, functional,
generic, and metaprogramming features. This power and flexibility make C++ a tool without equal, but can also cause confusion. 

Four parts:
1: C: blocks, statements, the preprocessor, built-in data types, arrayts, pointers, etc. all come from C. In many cases, C++ offers approaches
to problems that are superior to their C counterparts. (e.g. alternatives to the preprocessor in it)
