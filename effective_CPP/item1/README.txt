Today's C++ is a multiparadigm programming language, one supporting a combination of procedural, object-oriented, functional,
generic, and metaprogramming features. This power and flexibility make C++ a tool without equal, but can also cause confusion. 

Four parts:
1: C: blocks, statements, the preprocessor, built-in data types, arrayts, pointers, etc. all come from C. In many cases, C++ offers approaches
to problems that are superior to their C counterparts. (e.g. alternatives to the preprocessor in it)

2: Object-oriented C++. This part of C++ is what C with Classes was all about: classes(includeing constructors and destructors),
encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, virtual functions,(dynamic binding). This is the part of C++ to whichthe clasic rules for object-oriented design
most directly apply.

3: Template C++. This is the generic programming part of C++, the one that most programmers have the least experience with. Template considerations pervade C++,

4: The STL. The STL is a template library, but it's a very special template library.
